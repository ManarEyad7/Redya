## Overview

This project features Allam a powerful genrative model devlpoed by SADAIA. we have used Transfer learning technices by refining Allam along whith secondd model called Ashaar to devlop agent that capeple to understand and generate Arabic poetry. It includes capabilities for analyzing rhyme schemes and rhythms, providing efficient real-time responses, and offers a user-friendly website for interaction.

## Features

- **Poetry Understanding**: The model can analyze and comprehend the nuances of Arabic poetry.
- **Poetry Generation**: Users can generate original Arabic poems based on input prompts.
- **Rhyme and Rhythm Analysis**: Automatically analyzes the rhyme schemes and rhythmic patterns in Arabic poetry.
- **Real-Time Responses**: Provides quick feedback and results, enhancing user experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean and intuitive website that makes it easy for users to interact with the model.
